Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.\n\nInput: Premise: Gina needed to buy one gallon of water. \n Initial Context: So she grabbed a hand basket and went to the aisle. \n Original Ending: She hoped the store would have at least one gallon.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement.

We filtered out articles associated to less than 50 tweets. The resulting dataset contains overall $\\sim $1.7 million tweets for mainstream news, collected in a period of three weeks (February 25th, 2019-March 18th, 2019), which are associated to 6,978 news articles, and $\\sim $1.6 million tweets for disinformation, collected in a period of three months (January 1st, 2019-March 18th, 2019) for sake of balance of the two classes, which hold 5,775 distinct articles. Diffusion censoring effects BIBREF14 were correctly taken into account in both collection procedures. We provide in Figure FIGREF4 the distribution of articles by source and political bias for both news domains. For what concerns the Italian scenario we first collected tweets with the Streaming API in a 3-week period (April 19th, 2019-May 5th, 2019), filtering those containing URLs pointing to Italian official newspapers websites as described in BIBREF22; these correspond to the list provided by the association for the verification of newspaper circulation in Italy (Accertamenti Diffusione Stampa). We instead referred to the dataset provided by BIBREF23 to obtain a set of tweets, collected continuously since January 2019 using the same Twitter endpoint, which contain URLs to 60+ Italian disinformation websites. In order to get balanced classes (April 5th, 2019-May 5th, 2019), we retained data collected in a longer period w.r.t to mainstream news. In both cases we filtered out articles with less than 50 tweets; overall this dataset contains $\\sim $160k mainstream tweets, corresponding to 227 news articles, and $\\sim $100k disinformation tweets, corresponding to 237 news articles.

Article 1 (a) shall not apply in Member States in which films are usually shown in the language of their country of origin. The opening of a specialist cinema in a Member State shall not entitle any other Member State to grant any direct or indirect aid, whether financial or other, which would have the effect of distorting the conditions of establishment.In particular, no such aid shall be granted for:  - the construction, reconstruction or modernisation of any cinema;- the execution of work in connection with safety, hygiene or technical improvements;- the purchasing of equipment;- the renting of full-length films;- the covering of risks or trading losses.Any and every kind of aid available in the Member State in question for the opening of a specialist cinema shall be available without discrimination to operators who are nationals of other Member States of the Community.Beneficiaries from Member States shall in no instance be treated less favourably than natural persons or companies or firms from third countries. A Member State which, on the day of notification of this Directive, requires cinemas to set aside a minimum number of days per calendar year for the exhibition of domestic films (screen quota) shall, by 31 December 1966 at the latest, allow films having the nationality of one or more Member States to be included in the quota under the same conditions as those applicable to domestic films. That Member State may increase the number of days comprising its screen quota so as to allow for the inclusion of films from other countries.Member States which, on the day of notification of this Directive, do not impose screen quotas, may introduce such quotas provided that they are also applicable to films having the nationality of other Member States.Screen quotas shall not be applied to the specialist cinemas referred to in Article 1 (a). The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and at the request of a Member State, may, by a qualified majority, authorise that State to impose limits on the exhibition, whether in specialist or in non-specialist cinemas, of foreign films in the language of their country of origin where such language is that of the region in which the cinema is situated. Import quotas for films having the nationality of one or more Member States shall be abolished by 31 December 1966 at the latest.The Federal Republic of Germany shall, however, during the transitional period, retain the power to limit the importation of films having the nationalty of one or more Member States and in respect of which the national censorship authority has granted a certificate more than four years before the date on which the application to import is submitted to the competent authorities.Abolition of import quotas gives the right to import prints, dupes an advertising material without restriction.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task you will be given a list of strings and you need to concatenate them.\n\nInput: ['p', 'that.', 'o']<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a sentence from the research paper and the category to which it belongs.

To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.\n\nInput: Question: Was nylon invented during the Industrial Revolution?, Answer:No, Description of Industrial Revolution: Transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the 18th-19th centuries, Fact1: The Industrial Revolution occurred between 1750 and 1914., Fact2: The first example of nylon was invented in 1935.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not (53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome.

BC1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, is derived from the single copy BC1 RNA gene. The BC1 RNA gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for amplification of ID elements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

IT'S RUDE! The Navy is switching to a new messaging system that's cheaper and more efficient. And oh yeah, one that does away with a century-old practice: communications using all uppercase letters. \"Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format,\" a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. The all-caps were a vestige of a bygone era. Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters. Word of the change went out to all naval commands in April. But it didn't reach the rest of us until the news release this week. In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail. One with a very apt acronym: NICE (Navy Interface for Command Email). The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year. And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol. ALL CAPS READS LIKE YOU'RE BEING SHOUTED AT. Old sea dogs may feel differently. But they have a couple of months to adjust. The system won't fully be in place until next year. Once it is, naval officers will no longer feel like they're being barked at.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us.

John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. After Mary dies of an unrelated brain tumor, John discovers mysterious drawings of the creature that she had created prior to the night of the accident. Two years later, John becomes lost in West Virginia and inexplicably finds himself in Point Pleasant, hundreds of miles off his route. Driving in the middle of the night, his car breaks down; and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills (Laura Linney) defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door asking to use a phone, much to John's confusion. John stays at a local motel and considers how he ended up so far from his original destination. Officer Mills mentions to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people report seeing a large winged creature like a giant moth with red eyes. She also tells John about a strange dream she had, in which the words \"Wake up, Number 37\" were spoken to her. While conversing with Gordon one day, it is revealed to John that he had heard voices from his sink telling him that, in Denver, \"99 will die\". While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing a story on an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night, Gordon frantically explains that he had met the voices in his head, a being named Indrid Cold Later that night, Gordon calls John and says that he is standing with a character named Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold answers John's questions, convincing him that he is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the Ohio River. Later, John receives a call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from exposure. John becomes obsessed with the being, dubbed Mothman. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek (Alan Bates), who explains its nature and discourages John from becoming further involved. However, when John learns the governor (Murphy Dunne) plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. Soon afterwards, John receives a mysterious message that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in Georgetown, and he returns home. On Christmas Eve, Officer Mills calls and convinces him to ignore the phone call from \"Mary\", return to Point Pleasant, and join her. Though anguished, John agrees. As John reaches the Silver Bridge, a malfunctioning traffic light causes traffic congestion. As John walks onto the bridge to investigate, the bolts and supports of the bridge strain. The bridge comes apart, and John realizes that the prophesied tragedy on the Ohio River was about the bridge. As the bridge collapses, Officer Mills's car falls into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the river and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance, they see that 36 people have been killed, making Connie the \"number 37\" from her dream. The epilogue displays a series of graphics that state the cause of the bridge collapse was never fully determined. It also states that, although the Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant. \n Question: In what city is a plane crash prophesized?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you're given a context, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and an answer term.

They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world. Why was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants. Single parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth. Fast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets. \n Question: The passage is mainly about   _  . \n Options: (A) how and why \"McDonald's\" became successful (B) the effect social and economic changes have on people's eating habits (C) why Americans prefer natural food (D) American eating habits<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a question.

It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations.

JIA may involve one or many joints, and may also affect the eyes. It can cause other symptoms such as fevers or rash. Systemic onset JIA affects about ten percent of children with arthritis. Fast Facts. 1  Arthritis in children is treatable. 2  In spite of their diagnosis, most children with arthritis can expect to live normal lives. 3  Some children with JIA have their disease go into remission. 4  Federal and state programs may provide assistance with school accommodations or services. Both of these scenarios are more common in childhood inflammatory arthritis (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). When four or more joints are inflamed, the condition is referred to as polyarthritis. When only a few joints are inflamed, it is referred to as oligoarthritis. Other early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. During the early states of RA, you may feel a variety of symptoms, including: general weakness or a feeling of malaise; dry mouth; dry, itchy, or inflamed eyes; eye discharge; difficulty sleeping; chest pain when you breathe (pleurisy) hard bumps of tissue under the skin on your arms; loss of appetite; weight loss Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or JRA) annually affects one child in every thousand. There are six types of JIA. Treatment of juvenile arthritis depends upon the type the child has and should focus on treating the symptoms that manifest. Other early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis During the early states of RA, you may feel a variety of symptoms, including: general weakness or a feeling of malaise Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes chronic inflammation of joints.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nInput: Did M4 's male editor write , direct , executive produce , and produce M0 , M1 , and M2<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you're given reviews from Amazon's products.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\n\nInput: By myself I went.

They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world. Why was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants. Single parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth. Fast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets. \n Answer: the effect social and economic changes have on people's eating habits<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given concept set (with 3 to 5 concepts) that contain mentions of names of people, places, activities, or things.

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. \n\nInput: SQL: SELECT product_id FROM Product_Suppliers GROUP BY product_id HAVING Count ( * ) > 3 UNION SELECT product_id FROM Product_Suppliers WHERE total_value_purchased < 80000\nFeedback: In step 1 swap product suppliers with order items , in step 3 total amount purchased should be greater than 80000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'\n\nInput: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : My (34f) husband (44m) got in a huge fight last night and he just doesn't get it.\n\nI've been wanting a dog for awhile now and he's aware. We have 2 cats and 2 ferrets. We had 3 ferrets but 1 was really old with multiple health problems, which he had when we adopted him. He passed away. A week ago. My husband wants to get another one, but I don't. I do all the work for all the animals. The only thing I don't do is the cat litter box because of a health issue I have, my doctor says I'm not allowed to clean it. \n\nSo I brought up the issue about the dog. Before I could get a full sentence out, he cut me off and said, \"We're not getting a dog, that's final!\" He was extremely rude, belittling, and treated me like a child. I was just trying to have a discussion with him about this and he completely shut me down. This isn't the first time. He does this whenever he decides he's right and I'm wrong. But whenever he wants something (like the $1000 lightsaber he complains about) I always listen to him and then explain to him why we can't afford it at the time. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells because there have been times where I day something direct, like - \"Hey, do you think you could clean up after yourself in the kitchen? Thanks!\" He gets upset! I'm direct (but tactful) and I can't say things in a direct manner because he flips out and accuses me of \"blaming\" him and of being \"overly critical\". He also does this when it comes to the kids. He has a 15 year old son from a previous relationship and I have a 5 year old son. My son has chores and does more things around the house than my husband or my stepson. My stepson has no chores, constantly has issues at school for not turning in homework, and spends all of his time sleeping or playing video games. When I bring up the issue of my stepson doing some chores or helping out around the house, he accuses me of being lazy and foisting my housework off on the kids.\n\nI'm not upset about him saying no about the dog. I'm upset that he seems to think his word is law and rules our house like a patriarchy. Our relationship is very unequal. He acts like I'm a child - what he says goes and I'm not supposed to argue about it. \n\nThis morning (the fight happened last night) I tried to explain to him why I was upset, and he thinks it's all about the dog. He doesn't get that it's not the dog, it's his behavior! He thinks he had no choice in the ways he treated me and refuses to acknowledge any other alternative, though I gave him several. \n\nHe even texted my friend last night and blamed the entire thing on her, because it's \"her fault for making (me) want a dog\". She's done a lot for us, more than anyone else, but he says he has no respect for her. He refuses to see that this isn't about the dog. He thinks if it weren't for the dog thing, this never would've happened. Yes, it would, it would just be about something else because you repeatedly treat me like a child. He refuses to take any kind of responsibility for his actions and I'm to my breaking point. \n\nAm I wrong?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou will be given a context and a verb separated with a newline character.

When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases, precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneous, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nThe task is to generate text based off of an event.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (LC) in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \n The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \n Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , Shocktroopers , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier . Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types .

After seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book I was eager to buy it for my recent trip to Mexico City. Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations.

That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical.

Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the new question, this keyword should also be used the same way. Do not write unnatural questions. (i.e., would not be a question someone might normally ask about domains). Do not write open-ended or subjective questions. (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.) If you couldn't find the answer to your question from a single Google search, try to write a different question. You do not have to stick with the original question word for word, but you should try to create a question that combines the main subjects of the question.\n\nInput: What four-legged animals can be seen in this national park?

If his or her party controls the White House, the minority leader confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and political events generally. Strategically, the role of the minority leader will vary depending on whether the President is of the same party or the other party. In general, minority leaders will often work to advance the goals and aspirations of their party's President in Congress. When Robert Michel, R-IL, was minority leader (1981\u20131995), he typically functioned as the \"point man\" for Republican presidents. President Ronald Reagan's 1981 policy successes in the Democratic controlled House was due in no small measure to Minority Leader Michel's effectiveness in wooing so-called \"Reagan Democrats\" to support, for instance, the Administration's landmark budget reconciliation bill. There are occasions, of course, when minority leaders will fault the legislative initiatives of their President. On an administration proposal that could adversely affect his district, Michel stated that he might \"abdicate my leadership role [on this issue] since I can't harmonize my own views with the administration's.\" Minority Leader Gephardt, as another example, has publicly opposed a number of President Clinton's legislative initiatives from \"fast track\" trade authority to various budget issues. \nQuestion: How often does minority leader speak with president when party controls white house?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nWe would like you to assess the QUALITY of each of the following argument (discussing Gun Control) and determine if the argument is Valid or Invalid.

A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept.

For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.\n\nInput: Sentence: It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. \nQuestion: How long does it take to lure men to their downfall? \nCategory: Event Duration.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nThe task is to generate the correct answer for a given math problem.\n\nInput: Problem: a multiple choice test consists of 4 questions , and each question has 5 answer choices . in how many r ways can the test be completed if every question is unanswered ?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou will be given a context and a verb separated with a newline character, and you have to answer if the given verb can be anchored in time or not.

Thomas Howell) as six hundred and sixty six gigantic interplanetary robots land on Earth.As the robots are landing, two humanoids arrive, one male and one female (Sinead McCafferty). Both are eventually captured by the military who tries to communicate with them. Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others. Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed.Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention. An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by YF-22s. The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed by laser attack.The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is Skye, also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself. However, after using that, the military officer in charge of the \"mission\" starts to use a Taser on Skye, forcing Myron to intervene and be thrown off the project. He goes AWOL and as he is driving away, he is contacted by Skye telepathically and he returns to rescue her. The effort proves successful and starts a city-wide search for him and Skye.The male also manages to escape as the robots begin a systemic attack on the planet, first with an EMP (which aids in Josh rescuing Skye). It's also discovered that the robots are slowing down the Earth's core and stopping the planet's rotation.An effort is made to destroy one of the robots with a nuclear explosion, sacrificing 9000 inhabitants of a small island. When the bomb goes off, the machine emerges unharmed and Skye feels the pain of the people dying and almost passes out. Josh takes the time to comfort Skye before the military finds them again. Myron and Skye come across a married couple and have to put the wife in the back of a 4x4, as she is in labour. The husband delivers the child but is unaware of a complication until he realizes that his wife has stopped breathing. Myron hands the infant to Skye and tells her that if she wants to know the value of humanity, \"you're staring at it\". Myron and the husband desperately try to revive the wife but are unsuccessful. Myron realizes that the wife is dead and stops applying CPR. Skye, despite her earlier statement that she would not get involved, changes her mind and uses her powers to resurrect the wife.Skye, now convinced of the value of humanity, needs to get to the closest robot to return home and end the invasion. Before they can get to the robot, Skye is shot by the military. Both are taken back to the base where Skye is treated for the injury as the planet's rotation stops and a major global earthquake hits.The commander realizes, finally, that Myron was telling the truth and helps Myron move Skye to a vehicle. As they leave, they are chased by the psychologist, who is convinced that keeping Skye will prevent the robots from attacking further.At the feet of the robot, Myron is shot by the psychologist; the robot, reacting to a perceived threat, vaporizes him. The robot man arrives, sees both Skye and Myron possibly dead and uses his own powers to revive both. Skye, in gratitude, hugs Myron before both the unnamed man and Skye are beamed aboard. The invasion ends and the robots depart the planet leaving behind major damage (such as half of the Eiffel Tower being destroyed), but the planet intact.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou will be given a context and a verb separated with a newline character.

Therefore, 'to denigrate someone' would be 'to blacken that person'. Considering its current definition (see below) and the wish to be politically correct, I wonder whether the word has come to acquire any racist overtone. The reason why I'm asking is because I was reading 'Language Myths' a book by Laurie Bauer recently, and came across this passage which contained that word '...certain educational institutions denigrate the way certain ethnic minorities and lower-working-class children talk.' Then I remembered I was once told not to use 'denigrate' as it might be misinterpreted by some people. denigrate - from Merriam-Webster 1. to say very critical and often unfair things about (someone) 2. to attack the reputation of, to deny the importance or validity of, belittle EDIT (on Dec 17th, 2017) - This article, Dark Words Of Disapproval which Mari-Lou A mentions in one of the comments, shows very clearly the writer's feelings about this word, with very good arguments to bear him out.

A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance. (B)A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process. (C)Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings. (D)An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nCombine the given two facts to write a concluding fact.

I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things \"appear\" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this.

The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home. The homeowner, who was sitting in the living room watching television, was struck by the flying glass and injured. If the homeowner asserts a claim for his injuries against the sportsman, which of the following is the sportsman's best defense?\n(A)The earthquake was an act of God. (B)The sportsman's negligence, if any, merely created a passive condition and was not the activecause of the homeowner's injury.  (C)The sportsman could not reasonably have beenexpected to foresee injury to a person in thehomeowner's position. (D)The pedestrian's act of discarding the lightedcigarette in the street, which sparked the explosion, was the proximate cause of the homeowner's injury.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a list of integers in a random order.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firm\u2019s at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. \u201cHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to get our test approved, and they\u2019re not giving us an option of how to get it approved.\u201d   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. \u201cThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,\u201d she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. \u201cIf our test fails the validation, then it\u2019s not fit to go to market,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.\u201d<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given four sentences: a bot task sentence, a bot role sentence, a user task sentence and a user role sentence.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nThis task is reading a paragraph and determining if it has proper nouns in it or not.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the Term)  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

All renewals of this  Agreement  shall be on the same                            terms and conditions as are set forth herein.\n\n                  1.4      Company's Obligation.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (LC) in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than drop ship  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

POST : I am going to try to write this as neutral as possible, so I will try to stick to facts, no personal feelings.... I'm sure I'm going to fall short, but I'll give it a go.\nMy husband of well over a decade is about to deploy. This past weekend may be his last weekend home. His grandmother recently passed away. We (me, him, our daughter) attended the services on Friday, almost 3 hours from our house. When he and I moved in together, he hadn't talked with that set of grandparents in years. Nothing happened, they were just never close, and weren't big talkers, so it just happened. I made it a point for him (along with me and our children) to reconnect. We have spent an important holiday with them every year, for over 15 years. Including when he is deployed. I still take our kids to see that side of the family, even if he's not with us.\nSo, we go to the services, get home, and change into pajamas. I had mentioned 2 weeks prior that friends from work were meeting for dinner that night, but DID NOT say a word about it that day. He says \"you can go out.\" I ask if he's sure, throw some Jean's on, and head out. \nThe next day, we were supposed to take our kids to a Mardi Gras parade. This had been planned for weeks. I got up that morning, made breakfast, prepped, and arranged to pick up my daughter's friend. Then he said he and my son would just stay home. My daughter, me, and her friend drove down, had a great time with my aunt, sisters, and nieces. After the parade, we went to my friend's mom's house. Kids had a great time goofing off and eating ice cream.\nI started to get tired, so I texted my husband that we were going to drive back to my Aunt's. A 10 min drive vs. A 1 hour 30 min drive. He never texted back.\nNow he is super pissed at me. I can answer questions with more detail,  but this is the gist of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou are provided with an \"Event\", \"Intent\" and \"XEmotion\" (PersonX's reactions for the given \"Event\").

Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou are given a question on medical genetics.

The white rose movement was bolstered by one of the show-stopping moments of Grammys night: Kesha singing \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraying\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the help of fellow pop stars Cyndi Lauper  Bebe Rexha  Camila Cabello  Julia Michaels  and Andra Day  as well as The Resistance Revival Chorus. Prior to the show  Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich had said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraying\u00e2\u0080\u009d would have made an appearance regardless of \"whether these past few months [of #MeToo] had happened or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the song was charged with the context of the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094and made a social statement more complicatedly powerful than might be expected.\n Kesha  released \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraying\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a comeback single after she underwent a very public legal fight with her producer and label boss  Dr. Luke  over her allegations that he harassed and raped her. He denied her claims  and a judge nixed her attempt to be released from her record contract. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraying \u00e2\u0080\u009d an intense piano ballad put out through the label Luke founded  took a moving but oblique approach to the matter.  Kesha  sang to an unnamed someone who had harmed  her \u00e2\u0080\u0094to offer the hope that someday  his soul might be saved.\nThat somewhat saintly stance was emphasized tonight in the blazing white clothes of  Kesha  and  her  backup singers. A beautiful a cappella opening passage made the central lyric\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009csometimes  I pray for you at night\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094unmissable. But  Kesha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  intensity was not that of an exhortative preacher but of an actual  ailing human being.  She  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aim to hit the recorded version\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high notes  but  her  quavering voice and knotted eyebrows communicated sentiment that only a cynic could called canned. When the song ended   she  broke down crying  and was embraced by  her  famous compatriots.\nTo anyone familiar with the specifics of  Kesha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  situation and the state of the music industry  the subtext was not of total triumph. Over the decades  record companies have profited immensely from exactly the sort of exploitation of young female talent that  Kesha  accused Dr. Luke of partaking in. A study released by USC this past week brought stark confirmation of just how rare female singers  songwriters  and producers are in mainstream pop. And in the most important awards categories for this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Grammys  women are sidelined: All the Record of the Year nominees are men  and only one woman is nominated in Album of the Year and Song of the Year.\nTo address this state of affairs   Kesha  offered not revolutionary anger but solidarity  catharsis  and a call to take the high road. When introducing  Kesha   Janelle Monae gave a crisp  rousing #MeToo-themed speech that told women  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The swelling sound of \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraying\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested that taking power would happen at the same time as healing  and with surprising compassion for those who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve caused the wounds.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou are given a target race, and two sentences.

The categories can be identified using the following questions: \n Background: - Why is this problem important? - What relevant works have been done before? - What did the previous works miss? - What are the high-level research questions? - How might this help other researchers?\n Purpose: - What specific things do the researchers want to do? - What specific knowledge do the researchers want to know? - What specific hypothesis do the researchers want to test?\n Method: - How did the researchers do it or find it out? - What are the procedures and steps of this research?\n Finding/Contribution: - What did the researchers find out? Did the proposed methods work? - Did things behave as the researchers expected?\nOther: put every text fragment that does not fit into any of the categories above here. Put a sentence here if its not in English, is not part of the article, contains numbers and dates, is a caption of a figure or a table, is a formatting error, or you are not sure about it.\n\nInput: Background: From October 2010 through February 2016, Arizona conducted surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) among adults hospitalized in the Arizona-Mexico border region. There are few accurate mortality estimates in SARI patients, particularly in adults \u2265 65 years old. The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models. Results: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital. Mortality increased to 12% (30/258, 30% increase) when electronic vital records and a 30-day posthospitalization time frame were used. Being age \u2265 65 years (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6-9.9) and having an intensive care unit admission (OR = 7.4; 95% CI: 3.0-17.9) were independently associated with mortality. Conclusion: The use of electronic vital records increased SARI-associated mortality estimates by 30%. These findings may help guide prevention and treatment measures, particularly in high-risk persons in this highly fluid border population.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven a question, generate a paraphrase of that question wihout changing the meaning of it.

The classic ukiyo-e print by And\u014d Hiroshige (H\u014deid\u014d edition) from 1831 to 1834 depicts a Yahagibashi, one of the few bridges permitted by the Tokugawa shogunate on the T\u014dkaid\u014d, and one of the longest bridges built in Japan during the early Edo period. Okazaki Castle is depicted in the distance on the far shore of the river. Following the Meiji restoration, with the construction of railroads, the route of what became the Tokaido Main Line was laid down through the nearby village of Hane ( Hane-mura) to the south. Unlike Goyu-shuku and Akasaka-juku, but this did not cause a huge economic decline to Okazaki-shuku. There was a horse-drawn rail line connecting Okazaki to the train station, as well as a teachers' school, which kept the town alive. On the other hand, Okazaki was not able to compete with the growth of Toyohashi, which was located directly on the railway, and which gained city-status first. Because of fires during World War II and the subsequent rebuilding of Okazaki in the post-war years, there are few remnants of the post town remaining today.\n Link Information: Saigo Tsugiyori built an earthen-walled fortification in the Myodaiji area of Okazaki, near the present castle in 1455.

It is still commonly used today. Its formulation is still quite similar to what was used in 9 th century China. Black powder is considered a low explosive. It is a mixture that burns quickly, but the resulting shock wave travels at subsonic speeds. The speed at which it burns is dependent on the accessibility of oxygen atoms to the carbon source. In contrast, high explosives like nitroglycerin detonate instead of burning, creating shock waves that are supersonic (faster than the speed of sound).

She's 23 and I'm 24 now. We had great compatibility in the sense that we could handle decision making and disagreements maturely while also being silly and adventurous together. Soulmate material, right? Unfortunately, throughout the 2 years, we never had penetrative sex.\n\nIn the first few months of us dating, she tried to have an IUD insertion, but it was unsuccessful. We figured that it was one of those common situations where a woman that never had sex needs time for her vagina to adjust to penetration so that the pain can go away over time.\n\nShe was still in university while I've graduated a year ago. We would go on dates almost every weekend, but often didn't have the opportunity to engage in anything sexual because we would end up at her parents' house, so the most we could sneak in is a makeout session. I honestly didn't mind all of this that much, she was my first girlfriend and our relationship was mostly great otherwise. Sure, I had a healthy libido, but I could take care of myself. During that first year, we also had problems with finding the right condoms so that delayed things further. We were having outercourse when we had a place to ourselves, however rarely.\n\nIn year 2, she moved in with me for the second half of it, and that's where we could really start to make consistent progress since we would be at each other's disposal almost every day!... minus the period weeks, and minus when she just didn't feel like it since her libido was much lower than mine. She tried to practice self penetration with fingers and a small dildo. She made some progress in being able to fit things in a few inches without it being super painful. It wasn't really enough for sex though. She thought she might have endometriosis, so she went to her doctor. The visits, which were spread over a few months due to how busy her doctor was, didn't result in anything conclusive.\n\nAfter a year and a half of being patient, I was starting to lose that patience. I didn't see any hopeful signs that we would be able to have sex anytime soon. I also felt like she wasn't prioritizing this problem enough by escalating her doctor visits and seeing more specialists. She was busy and stressed with finishing up school, dealing with her family, and then looking for a job. I empathized with that, so I kept giving her more time. Eventually, close to the end of year 2, we had one of our many \"heart-to-heart\" conversations where we discussed our situation and how she feels that she is holding me back from experiencing a \"normal\" relationship where the couple can have \"normal\" sex. I also expressed that I'm running out of patience and just don't see an end to this struggle in our near future. We both agreed that she should move back in with her parents at the end of the month and that we should break up, but remain friends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max.

I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still.

Why not?\n(A)Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living. (B)Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nInput: Step 1: For each row in Apartments table, find the corresponding rows in Apartment_Bookings table.\nStep 2: find the average bathroom_count in the results of step 1 whose booking_status_code equals Provisional<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a piece of an article.

Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, \"okay, it's just the carpet.\" Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things \"appear\" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this.

In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. In the gift-giving example, X may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, in an event such as PersonX steals a car, PersonX may be perceived as evil. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.\n\nInput: Head: PersonX has ___ one night<sep>Tail: happy<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nTwo analogies that relate places/locations to the associated travel mode is given in the form \"A : B.

Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. \n\nThe Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology. The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. \n\nIn March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. \n\nThe Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century; they contain another 150,000 items. \n\nScholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods, Pre-Lateran, Lateran, Avignon, Pre-Vatican and Vatican. \n\nThe Pre-Lateran period, comprising the initial days of the library, dated from the earliest days of the Church.

Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words.

You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \"flipping\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \"flipping\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \"increase\" to \"decrease.\"\n\nInput: Background Paragraph: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let's say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. \nStory: A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail. His son came along and saw the two cups and decided to put some sugar in them to make a tasty drink. The child poured two spoonfuls of sugar into cup A and three spoonfuls of sugar into cup B.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX.

The aims of this study were to validate measurement of total T (TT) at our laboratory in order to obtain reference ranges for TT, calculated free T (CFT), calculated bioavailable T (CBT), and salivary T (ST) in healthy young men from the Mediterranean region, and to evaluate the potential clinical value of ST by establishing its correlation with serum T.', 'An observational, cross-sectional study with sequential sampling.', 'men aged 18-30 years with body mass index (BMI)<30.', \"chronic diseases, hepatic insufficiency or use of drugs altering circulating T levels. Main outcome measures TT (chemiluminescent immunoassay UniCell DXI 800 [Access T Beckman Coulter]), CFT and CBT (Vermeulen's formula), and ST (radioimmunoassay for serum TT modified for saliva [Coat-A-Count, Siemens]).

When the film opens, the Conners are finishing a con on Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played many times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Dean's secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Max's immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.Page declares that she wants to go solo. Max initially relents, but when they go to the bank to split their earnings, they're confronted by an IRS agent (Anne Bancroft) who declares that they owe the government a considerable sum on top of the rest of their savings, which have already been seized. Page reluctantly agrees to work one last con with Max in Palm Beach, to get enough money to pay off the IRS and set Page up to work on her own. For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a tobacco baron who is addicted to his own product.While working the main con with Tensy, Page attempts a side con without her mother's knowledge. Page targets beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), who is worth $3 million, but develops genuine feelings for him. Max learns of the side con and tells Page to break the relationship off, which Page does reluctantly.Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he accidentally chokes and dies while trying to initiate sex with Max. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down to apologize and propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page conned him, and threatens to call the authorities. Max offers to return Dean's divorce settlement money if he'll help them make Tensy's death look like an accident. Max tells Page that their money wasn't really taken by the IRS; the agent was Max's mentor, Barbara, who agreed to help prevent Page from leaving. However, when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really has gone, having been liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.In order to help Max, Page returns to Jack and accepts his proposal, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when, on their wedding night, she breaks into her mother's room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a \"goody-goody\" like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him, but she defends her actions by saying that Jack would hurt Page eventually. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves because of what \"might\" happen.Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her efforts to protect her daughter have only hurt her in other ways. Page returns to Jack, giving him back the bar he'd had to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still loves Max despite what she put him through. The final shot of the film is of Dean \u00e2\u0080\u0094 using the name 'Stanley' \u00e2\u0080\u0094 romancing Barbara, with Max watching them via binoculars, implying that Max and Dean are now working together to get Max's money back from Barbara., Question: Who was Page working the main con with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven a text, write a compressed version of it in a single sentence.\n\nInput: While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea, the people who need jobs are floundering.

In spite of numerous searches, three of 16 victims - known as the Disappeared - have not been found. They are Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Capt Robert Nairac. Mr McVeigh's brother Oliver said the donation was \"great news\". \"Anything that helps the recovery process is very welcome,\" he added. Crimestoppers takes calls anonymously by telephone or accepts information through an anonymous online form. It says any information that it receives will be passed only to the Independent Commission for the Location of the Victims' Remains (ICLVR). The ICLVR was set up to obtain information that may lead to where the bodies of the Disappeared are buried. Information it receives is strictly confidential and is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. 'Help victims' relatives' Fiona McCormack, the director of operations at Crimestoppers, said anonymity would be maintained for those who present new information. \"People giving information can be safe in the knowledge that no-one will ever know who they are - not even us,\" she said. \"That is a promise we have kept since the charity began more than 30 years ago. \"The commission is doing an excellent job and to date the remains of 13 of the 16 Disappeared have been recovered.\" Ms McCormack said the reward was \"not about finding out what happened to these people\" but rather to give victims' relatives the chance to \"hold a long-overdue funeral\". \"The reward was put up by an anonymous donor and is $20,000 (\u00a315,730) for the recovery of each body,\" she added. \"It can only be claimed for information that goes directly to the Crimestoppers charity.\" Geoff Knupfer, the lead investigator for the ICLVR, said his organisation was \"not really interested\" in who the anonymous donor was but he believed the money \"might prove to be a game-changer\". \"We do understand the payment of money for information is a contentious issue at the best of times,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. \"But we have to make it clear that this is a humanitarian process. \"It's nothing to do with crime, it's simply about recovering the remains of the outstanding victims and returning them to their families - it's about closure.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nThe input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.\nThe family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.\nWhen Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.\nAfter his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain's life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Cura ao to convince his fellow officers they've been poisoned. He also keeps correspondence with Minnie, developing a romance with the beautiful heiress.\nNear the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged. After being saved by another English vessel, he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely's sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property. Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father's name. He later journey's with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie, but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying. During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks, Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road. At the end of the novel, Percival proposes to Minnie, and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father. He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nConstruct a question that every answer in the list is correct and reasonable for it.\n\nInput: news, talking, weather, jokes, commercials, traffic, sports<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a multiple-choice question about healthcare.

People having to stay in hospital, even though they are well enough to be discharged, because there' s no social care in place for them . David Cameron says it's \"a demand problem\" . But it's not, of course . It's a supply problem . It's hard to make money from social care . So it's not massively amenable to privatisation . I suppose this was one of the areas where, Cameron fondly imagined, the Big Society would step in . As ever, instead, starving one part of the public sector of cash simply left another part struggling to cope with the consequences . Back in 2010, when Gordon Brown suggested implementing a 10% levy on inherited wealth to fund social care for older people , the Conservatives had this to say:\"RIP off. Now Gordon wants ? 20,000 when you die. Don't vote for Labour's new death tax.\" Instead , social care for older people has had its funding cut , so there' s simply not enough money to go round . The demand problem that Cameron now speaks of is one that was entirely predictable and, indeed, entirely predicted . Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades . Now this time has arrived , and there' s nothing there in the way of provision for it . Care for elderly people is one of those things that's not hard to sort out, given money, and almost impossible to sort out without it . It's one of those things that, in theory, offers choice- staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care . In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect of being in a position where they have to make such choices that they'd rather not think about it at all . One knows vaguely that there aren't many decent alternatives , so staying at home becomes the one thing that is comforting . Being close to the past matters when the present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death . It doesn't help that there's so much sentimentality around the issue . Myleene Klass appeared to believe she was being socially aware by banging on about how awful the idea of a mansion tax is , because it would hurt little old ladies living in big houses that had been their homes for decades . But ,  actually, Klass was describing something that isn't necessarily that desirable: an elderly person living in a home she can no longer heat, clean or look after, the neighbours she once knew long gone, clinging to the past instead of living in and enjoying the present . One of the great paradoxes of old age is that, at a time in life when change is very dynamic and has to be managed a lot, people are persuaded that trying to stop time, instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances, is the right thing to do . Care at home is pushed as the thing to aspire to, in part because - even though it's expensive, difficult to organise and not very satisfactory in outcome - it has the attractive advantage of needing no capital investment . Over Christmas, I watched the film Quartet , which is set in a retirement home for musicians . One was supposed to feel a bit sorry for its inhabitants , who had known success and adulation when they were young, and who missed those days . All they had to do to raise the funds to keep the home going was put on a concert featuring the legends that were themselves . Having looked at a couple of local care homes when my mother was ill a couple of years back , I can only say that the twilight years of those characters were indeed a fiction . Sure, nice retirement homes exist - if you can afford them . But the limitations of so many of them mean that the whole concept is sullied . Rather than being places where new phases of life are undertaken, they have become places you end up in when all hope of enjoying life is gone . It's interesting that inheritance has become so much an aspect of debate around care for elderly people . This, too, is a tacit signal that you are too old to spend your own money on yourself . At some point, the duty is to hang on to your assets, so that they can be passed on to your family - and without nasty government death taxes . It would be nice if people weren't encouraged to believe that it was selfish to invest in their own lives just because they are no longer young . Elderly people are blocking beds not just because they can no longer look after themselves at home, but also because our society is not encouraged to think of elderly lives as valuable and deserving of joy and fun, vitality and change . Lack of pay is one reason why people aren't queing up to work with older people . But another is that it's not seen as enjoyable , because older people are viewed as a bundle of sad, expensive, social-policy problems, rather than people with lives worth living to the full .<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nYou are given a question on college medicine.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (LC) in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than drop ship  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

Passage:The first obelisks may start to appear in the later 16th century and it is suggested that the obelisk on Compton Pike is Elizabethan in date. More securely dated is a series of obelisks which start to appear in the 18th century. The first of these was the Wakeman obelisk of 1702 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, which is set in the square at Richmond, Yorkshire. Probably several hundred obelisks exist in the British Isles dating from 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these obelisks, which are often landmarks commemorate famous people and their achievements. At Stowe in Buckinghamshire an obelisk was erected in memory of Wolfe's victory at Quebec in 1752, while at the death of the Duke of Cumberland in 1765 was noted by an obelisk at Englefield Green in Surrey. Thomas Coke, Earl of Leicester, Coke of Norfolk the farming pioneer has a particularly fine obelisk, set up in the park he created at Holkham in Norfolk. Sometimes an obelisk was used to mark the site of a battle such as the obelisk on the site of English Civil War battlefield at Naseby in Leicestershire. Occasionally obelisks are used as mile markers, as on the Great North Road at a mile from Westminster. In Lincoln an elaborate obelisk was set up on the High Bridge in 1762\u201363 as a conduit for dispensing water, while Anthony Salvin used obelisks as water fountains on the Belton House estates in Lincolnshire.\n Links: a.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Turns any controller into a smart controller. The SMRT-Y Soil Moisture Sensor Kit is an easy to install add-on to any standard irrigation system that directly links your irrigation controller to your landscapes moisture requirements. Program the controller to water every day that irrigation is allowed, and the soil moisture sensor will do the rest. As the SMRT-Y optimizes moisture at the root zone, you will enjoy a lush, healthier landscape that is less prone to fungus and shallow root growth. User Interface with LCD Readout. 1  Touchpad keys with digital LCD readout displays: 2  Automatic moisture threshold setting with increase/decrease adjustment. 3  Sensor bypass touchpad key for easy deactivation. 4  Up to two independent zones can be isolated from sensor. 5  Designed for outdoor installation. The moisture sensor works when the series of discs in the sensor expands they get wet, and to a certain size, they flip a micro switch, this interrupts the current going from the controller to the valves, whereby the controller will tell the valves to start watering in the middle of a rainstorm, if the valves do not get the memo then they don't turn ... A moisture sensor estimates the amount of water in the soil that is being tested. It works by measuring the soil's ability to conduct electricity, higher moisture means more c\u2026onducting power. The reason that some look down on soil moisture meters is because of the plethora of crappy and cheap ones that don't actually work well... but not all meters are bad. I use this soil moisture sensor in my house for my potted plants, and I actually have been very pleased with it. Advanced TDT Digital Soil Moisture Sensor. 1  Sensor uses Time Domain Transmissometry (TDT) and digital signal processing to measure soil moisture content accurately and consistently. 2  Corrosion-resistant in-ground sensor made of high-grade 304 stainless steel. 3  No maintenance sensor \u2013 just bury and forget. soil moisture meters are garbage!! Lift up a bone dry pot and feel what it weighs. thatll give you an idea. like he said ! ... use your fingers.... a couple inches deep and still dry its time to water! I dont water heavey. I find it better to water lightly more often (2-3 days) instead of drenching the soil. At field capacity most soils have a soil moisture tension between 0.05 and 0.33 bars. Soils classified as sandy may have field capacity tensions around 0.10 bars, while clayey soil will have field capacity at a tension around 0.33 bars. At field capacity it is relatively easy for a plant to remove water from the soil. Discussion in 'Organics' started by BillyBonnie, May 30, 2012. BillyBonnie New Member.

Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

Passage:It was founded around 1072 as a Benedictine priory by William FitzOsbern and his son Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. FitzOsbern had been granted the Lordship of Striguil by his second cousin King William in gratitude for his support in the Norman conquest of England, and was responsible for starting the building of a new castle overlooking the River Wye on the border with the kingdoms of Wales. At the same time he established a nearby monastic cell, so as to collect rent from the lands within Gwent which he had granted to his home Priory of Cormeilles in Normandy. By the early 12th century, the monastic establishment, on a ridge overlooking the river about 300 metres from the castle, had the status of an alien priory in its own right, though it probably never held more than about 12 monks. It superseded an earlier Augustinian priory located about 2\u00a0km away, which was dedicated to the Welsh saint Cynfarch (or St. Kingsmark), a disciple of St. Dyfrig.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a country name, and you need to return the country's surface area in terms of square kilometers.

For example,, who could have thought that a spider would become friends with a pig? But in American writer E.B.White' novel Charlotte's Web, this is exactly what happens Wibur the pig grows up in a barn  and makes many friends, including a spider called Charlotte. One day a sheep tells Wibur that he will finally be served up as dinner. But Charlotte decides to save her friend. To help Wibur,Charlotte writes words like \"terrific\", \"radiant\" and \"humble\" on her web to praise Wibur. This makes the farmer believe that is too important to kill.Wibur is saved, but Charlotte is so tired that she dies. The book was first published in 1952.  In over 60 years Charlotte has become one of the most famous spiders of all time. She teaches us about love and promise. \"She is very, very loving under that crusty ,that ugly look,\"  Peter Neumeyer, writer of The Annotated Charlott's Web The book's success drew the attention of Hollywood filmmakers , however, they wanted a happier ending. White was strongly against this idea and as a result the film, like the book, ends with Charlotte's death. Jen Doll, reporter with The Atlantic, believe that \"death is a part of life\". She says this is one of the main messages of the book. As Charlotte tells Wibur, \"You have been my friend. That in itself is a wonderful thing. I wove my webs for you because I like you. After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while and then we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess , with all this trapping and eating flies.

Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \"event duration\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\"brushing teeth\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \"being born in the U.S.\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \"being hungry\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" of events, which refers to how often events are repeated (e.g., \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.).

I'd place this easily in the lower two or three of Elvis Presley's very worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken-down shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandpa is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's cattle, but they're lacking a bull. Elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs, and is pursued by a young boy-crazy gal and her gun-toting mother. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don't make this much easier. The one thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film.

Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

The telomeric repeat of hypotrichous ciliates, d(T(4)G(4)), forms a 16-nucleotide 3'-overhang. Such sequences can adopt parallel-stranded as well as antiparallel-stranded quadruplex conformations in vitro. Although it has been proposed that guanine-quadruplex conformations may have important cellular roles including telomere function, recombination, and transcription, evidence for the existence of this DNA structure in vivo has been elusive to date. We have generated high-affinity single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) probes for the guanine-quadruplex formed by the Stylonychia telomeric repeat, by ribosome display from the Human Combinatorial Antibody Library. Of the scFvs selected, one (Sty3) had an affinity of K(d) = 125 pM for the parallel-stranded guanine-quadruplex and could discriminate with at least 1,000-fold specificity between parallel or antiparallel quadruplex conformations formed by the same sequence motif. A second scFv (Sty49) bound both the parallel and antiparallel quadruplex with similar (K(d) = 3--5 nM) affinity. Indirect immunofluorescence studies show that Sty49 reacts specifically with the macronucleus but not the micronucleus of Stylonychia lemnae. The replication band, the region where replication and telomere elongation take place, was also not stained, suggesting that the guanine-quadruplex is resolved during replication. Our results provide experimental evidence that the telomeres of Stylonychia macronuclei adopt in vivo a guanine-quadruplex structure, indicating that this structure may have an important role for telomere functioning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you will be shown a passage.

It was not immediately clear exactly how the alert was linked to the terror group. Threats were made against the central Hauptbahnhof station and the Pasing station west of the city, Police Chief Hubertus Andrae said. The stations were evacuated on Thursday evening and service stopped for around eight hours. Authorities told the public additional officers were being called in to find possible suspects. On Friday, 100 additional officers were still on duty, Andrae said.The plot involved five to seven potential suicide attackersThe tip about the plot came from another country's intelligence agencyPolice asked residents to avoid large public crowds<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to find the mean (average) of that list.

For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you need to identify the sentiment of the given sentence as one of 'positive' or 'negative.\n\nInput: with pale blue berries. in these peaceful shades--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question.

Very rarely, it also displays a \"crazy paving\" pattern (also described as a \"paving stone,\" \"flagstone,\" or \"slabstone\" pattern), which is rarer still in discrete bilateral nodules. This pattern is considered to be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but its association with various diseases is unclear. Case presentation: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary melanoma. Computed tomography revealed discrete bilateral nodules surrounded by a \"paving\" pattern. A literature review found more than 40 types of diseases that have presented with \"paving\" patterns in the lung-predominantly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, viral pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS, squalene aspiration pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary leptospirosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary nocardiosis. Conclusions: We describe the first case of pulmonary melanoma in the form of discrete bilateral nodules accompanied with a computed tomography paving pattern. Although pulmonary paving patterns are rare, more than 40 diseases reportedly display them; clinicians should consider melanoma of the lung in differential diagnoses for patients who show such a pattern. \n Title: Pulmonary melanoma and \"crazy paving\" patterns in chest images: a case report and literature review<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given two facts, and a multiple-choice question.

Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event. \nQuestion: What is the first name of the person who doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven a part of privacy policy text, identify the type of personal information which is collected, used, tracked or retained.

Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China, tea houses, which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture, as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan.

As of the beginning of the 2006\u201307 NBA season, he officiated 1,649 regular season, 145 playoff, and 11 NBA Finals games as well as the 1998 All-Star Game. He was also one of three former NBA players (Leon Wood and Haywoode Workman) who officiated in the league. During a 2002 playoff game between the Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic, Fryer and his officiating crew disallowed a field goal made by the Hornets Baron Davis. Davis received an inbound pass with 0.7 seconds remaining and successfully made the shot before the buzzer sounded. This incident led Commissioner David Stern to consider the use of instant replay in NBA games. Considered one of the top-rated referees in the league, he retired in 2007 following Game 3 of the 2007 NBA Finals having officiated 1,806 NBA games.

Our hearts still ache for the futures snatched away, the lives that might have been,\" he said.\nThe attacks led to a long war in Afghanistan and created an expansion of government surveillance powers that have recently been the subject of intense debate.\nA separate memorial service was held outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, honouring the passengers and crew of United Flight 93. They struggled with the hijackers of the plane, preventing it from hitting its intended target, believed to be the White House or the US Capitol building.\nAll 33 passengers and seven crew members on the flight were killed after the plane crashed into a field about 75 miles (120km) south-east of Pittsburgh.\n\"No matter how many years pass, this time comes around each year, and it's always the same,\" Karen Hinson, who lost her brother, Michael Wittenstein, in New York, told the Associated Press news agency.

Church marriage law presumes that a married couple will have intercourse unless proven otherwise. Then, the burden of proof was on Catherine, and the operative word is \"proof\". Catherine's unsupported word should not have sufficed, and at the time she made this claim, she was not a virgin. Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.\n\nHowever, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost. Pope Clement VII did not want a re-run of that war, so he stalled by taking Catherine's claim seriously.

In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven a phrase describing the relationship between two words, extract the words and the lexical relationship between them.

At issue in conservative author Peter Schweizer\u2019s forthcoming book Clinton Cash are donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the four years she served as secretary of state. George Stephanopoulos used an interview with Schweizer on ABC This Week to point out what other nonpartisan journalists have found: There is no \"\"smoking gun\"\" showing that donations to the foundation influenced her foreign policy decisions. Still, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the donations are \"\"clearly illegal\"\" under federal law. In his view, a donation by a foreign government to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state is the same as money sent directly to her, he said, even though she did not join the foundation\u2019s board until she left her post. \"\"The Constitution of the United States says you cannot take money from foreign governments without explicit permission of the Congress. They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous,\"\" Gingrich said. \"\"You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars \u2014 oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department.\"\" He continued, \"\"My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal.\"\" PunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened \"\"clearly illegal\"\"? A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich\u2019s accusation \"\"a baseless leap\"\" because Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline. Foundation basics Former President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it\u2019s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions. Hillary Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while she was a senator or\u00a0secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors. According to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve. Clinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015. The Emoluments Clause So how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are \"\"clearly illegal\"\" and unconstitutional? The answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part: \"\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\" The framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence. (An emolument, per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is \"\"the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites.\"\") Lest you think the law is no longer relevant, the Pentagon ethics office in 2013 warned employees the \"\"little known provision\"\" applies to all federal employees and military retirees. There\u2019s no mention of spouses in the memo. J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts. \"\"I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause,\"\" Pham said. Expert discussion We asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \"\"clearly illegal\"\" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause. We did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich. The American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \"\"even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\"\" said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced. \"\"I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\"\" he said. \"\"Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they\u2019re formally \u2014 and, thus, legally \u2014 distinct.\"\" Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich\u2019s link between Clinton and the foreign governments\u2019 gifts to the Clinton Foundation as \"\"implausible, and in any case I don\u2019t think we have the facts to support it.\"\" \"\"The truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,\"\" Delahunty said. John Harrison, University of Virginia law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1990 to 1993, pointed to the Foreign Gifts Act, 5 U.S.C. 7432, which sets rules for how the Emoluments Clause should work in practice. The statute spells out the minimal value for acceptable gifts, and says it applies to spouses of the individuals covered, but \"\"it doesn\u2019t say anything about receipt of foreign gifts by other entities such as the Clinton Foundation.\"\" \"\"I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s any other provision of federal law that would treat a foreign gift to the foundation as having made to either of the Clintons personally,\"\" Harrison said, who added that agencies have their own supplemental rules for this section, and he did not know if the State Department addressed this. Other experts on the libertarian side of the scale thought Gingrich was more right in his assertion. Clinton violates the clause because of its intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of \"\"any kind whatever,\"\" which would cover indirect gifts via the foundation, said Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute. Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton\u2019s decision while secretary of state. Delahunty thought Kopel\u2019s reasoning would have \"\"strange consequences,\"\" such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted\u00a0as a gift to Hillary Clinton. Our ruling Gingrich said the Clinton Foundation \"\"took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state. It is clearly illegal. \u2026 The Constitution says you can\u2019t take this stuff.\"\" A clause in the Constitution does prohibit U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign governments. But the gifts in this case were donations from foreign governments that went to the Clinton Foundation, not Hillary Clinton. She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state. Does that violate the Constitution? Some libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could. Others are skeptical. What\u2019s clear is there is room for ambiguity, and the donations are anything but \"\"clearly illegal.\"\" The reality is this a hazy part of U.S. constitutional\u00a0law. Claim: \"The money the Clinton Foundation took from from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state \"\"is clearly illegal. \u2026 The Constitution says you can\u2019t take this stuff.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a hateful post in English from online platforms.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a sentence.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nInput: What is the average and the maximum capacity of all stadiums?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated.

It was established in 1838 and competes every year in Torpids and Summer Eights, the intercollegiate bumps races at the University of Oxford, as well as external regattas. Context_2 : Dead Man's Walk (or Deadman's Walk) is a footpath running east\u2013west in central Oxford, England, situated immediately to the south of Merton College and just outside the old city wall, with Corpus Christi College at the western end. To the north, Grove Walk connects with Merton Street through a gateway. Immediately to the south is Merton Field with Merton Walk connecting to the wide tree-lined Broad Walk, which runs parallel with Dead Man's Walk. Beyond that is Christ Church Meadow. Context_3 : The 5th son of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, he was educated at Merton College, Oxford. A Chaplain to George III he held livings at Wonston, Crawley, Hampshire and North Waltham.

Context_4 : Merton College Library (in Merton College, Oxford) is one of the earliest libraries in England and the oldest academic library in the world still in continuous daily use. The library is located in several parts of the college, and houses a priceless collection of early printed books and more than 300 medieval manuscripts. The historic collection was initially built through benefactions, including manuscripts donated by the medieval clergyman William Reade. The library also contains early printed books from the personal libraries of Griffin Higgs and Henry Kent, who originally donated approximately 600 and 800 volumes respectively. The main collection runs to approximately 70,000 volumes. Context_5 : Merton College Chapel is the church of Merton College, Oxford, England. Dedicated to St Mary and St John the Baptist, the chapel was largely completed in its present form the end of the 13th century. Context_6 : In the 14th-century, the Oxford Calculators of Merton College and French collaborators such as Nicole Oresme proved the mean speed theorem, also known as the Merton rule of uniform acceleration, or the Merton mean speed theorem. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with uniform speed whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.

(Associated Press) \n  \n This image taken from CCTV video obtained by the Turkish broadcaster TRT World and made available on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018, shows a vehicle allegedly belonging to the Saudi consulate, at the entrance to Belgrade Forest in Istanbul, Turkey, Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan... (Associated Press) \n  \n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 In a fiery and unwavering appearance Wednesday at an investment forum, Saudi Arabia's crown prince called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi \"heinous\" and \"painful to all Saudis,\" before warning anyone against trying to \"manipulate\" the crisis and drive a wedge between the kingdom and Turkey. \n  \n Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was joined onstage by two Arab allies as he made his first extensive public remarks about the killing that has sparked widespread condemnation and marred his international standing after Turkish reports said a member of his entourage was involved in the crime. \n  \n Many international business leaders pulled out of the Future Investment Initiative, the kingdom's main economic forum, after the Oct. 2 killing of The Washington Post columnist inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. \n  \n But in the forum's vast and ornate auditorium, thousands of people who did attend rose to their feet to applaud the 33-year-old heir whose strong showing underscored his reputation for being bold and assertive. \n  \n Prince Mohammed, who spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone before the forum, addressed the case immediately after taking the stage for a panel discussion, saying the Saudis were cooperating with Turkey on the Khashoggi investigation. \n  \n \"The situation that took place is very painful to all Saudis, especially because it was a Saudi citizen. And I suspect it is painful to anyone in the whole world,\" Prince Mohammed said. \n  \n \"It is a heinous act that is unjustifiable,\" he added, before cautioning anyone who might try \"to manipulate the situation\" and sow division between Riyadh and Ankara. \n  \n \"I have a message for them: They will not be able to do that as long as there is a king called Salman bin Abdul-Aziz and a crown prince called Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi, and a president in Turkey called Erdogan,\" he said to applause. \n  \n Erdogan on Tuesday delivered a sharp rebuttal of Saudi Arabia's widely criticized account that the dissident writer died accidentally in a brawl, saying Saudi officials had planned the killing for days. \n  \n He kept up the pressure Wednesday, saying in Ankara: \"We are determined not to allow the murder to be covered up and for those responsible \u2014 from the person who gave the order to those who executed it \u2014 not to escape justice.\" \n  \n Erdogan has said that 15 Saudi officials arrived in Istanbul shortly before Khashoggi's death and that a man, apparently dressed in the writer's clothes, acted as a possible decoy by walking out of the consulate on the day of the disappearance. \n  \n Turkish officials say the 15 men comprised a Saudi hit squad that included a member of Prince Mohammed's entourage on overseas trips. Saudi Arabia has suggested, without offering evidence, that the team went rogue. It has arrested 18 Saudis and fired five top officials, some of whom worked directly under the crown prince. \n  \n Turkish media have published a security camera image showing a vehicle belonging to the Saudi Consulate purportedly scouting a forest in the outskirts of Istanbul before the killing. \n  \n The killing of the 59-year-old Khashoggi has created an international firestorm as suspicion mounts that the crown prince had a hand in the killing. \n  \n \"Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,\" President Donald Trump was quoted telling the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. \n  \n Khashoggi, who lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. for nearly a year before his death, had written critically of the young prince's crackdown on dissent. Dozens of Saudi activists, writers, clerics and even women who were behind calls for the right to drive have been detained. \n  \n King Salman and Prince Mohammed met Tuesday with Khashoggi's son, Salah, and his brother, Sahel, at the Yamama Palace, where the royals expressed their condolences, according to state-run Saudi news, which distributed photos of the event. A friend of the Khashoggi family told The Associated Press that Salah has been under a travel ban since last year. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal. \n  \n The crisis overshadowed the crown prince's high-profile economic forum, aimed at raising much needed investments to underwrite his plans to overhaul the Saudi economy. \n  \n After the killing, many international business leaders and Western officials pulled out of the forum, including the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Uber, Siemens and Blackrock. Western media outlets withdrew as partners for the event. \n  \n Instead, the forum spotlighted how the kingdom's regional allies have rushed to rally behind the crown prince. \n  \n On stage with him was Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who abruptly resigned his post last year during a strange visit to Saudi Arabia in which many people suspected that he was held against his will. Hariri returned to Lebanon and to his post later that year after French mediation and has visited Saudi Arabia and met with the crown prince since then. \n  \n The crown prince even joked about the incident at the forum, saying Hariri would be in Saudi Arabia this time for two days. \n  \n \"So please, no one say that he is kidnapped,\" Prince Mohammed said, before turning to Hariri and pumping his hand as the crowd erupted in laughter. \n  \n The summit also drew Dubai's ruler, Jordan's king and Pakistan's prime minister. Pakistan, which is grappling with a soaring deficit, struck a deal on the sidelines of the forum with Saudi Arabia for $6 billion in aid from the oil-rich kingdom. \n  \n Some $55 billion in agreements were signed at the forum, much of that focused on the lucrative Saudi energy industry. Saudi Arabia is one of the world's largest exporters of oil, has the Arab world's largest economy and is a key emerging market. \n  \n Rather than cancel their participation altogether, some companies sent midlevel executives. Outside the hall, hushed conversations over coffee and dates took place, with a flurry of business cards exchanged. \n  \n Several participants from the U.S., including a California hedge fund manager and staff from a U.S. desalination company, declined to speak to the AP, reflecting a general nervousness among the Americans. \n  \n \"This experience has given everyone pause ... to stop, get our breath, take stock and then figure out the most appropriate way forward,\" David Hamod, president and CEO of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce, told the AP. \n  \n \"At the end of the day, many American companies have stakeholders and shareholders to which they need to be very sensitive. So they will listen to those stakeholders and shareholders,\" Hamod said. \n  \n \"But timing is everything. A fair number of U.S. companies didn't make the trip, as you know, and that's an issue of timing,\" he said, adding that he believes the relationship will be \"very positive\" in the long term. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Zarar Khan in Islamabad; Malak Harb in Riyadh; and Jan M.

Members of the prince\u2019s security staff are among those named by Turkish authorities as having carried out the killing. \n  \n Profile Jamal Khashoggi Show Hide Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia who has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and the Guardian. \n  \n His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws. Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency. He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign. Photograph: Virginia Mayo/AP \n  \n Bin Salman announced a restructuring of the kingdom\u2019s national security agencies and said Saudi Arabia and Turkey would work together \u201cto reach results\u201d. \n  \n \u201cThe incident that happened is very painful, for all Saudis \u2026 The incident is not justifiable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will not be able to divide us as long as there is a king called King Salman bin Abdulaziz and a crown prince named Mohammed bin Salman, and a president in Turkey named Erdo\u011fan.\u201d \n  \n But in a sign that the Saudis\u2019 attempts to address the issue had failed to convince its western allies, No 10 said Theresa May had called King Salman on Wednesday \u201cto reiterate the UK\u2019s grave concerns about the murder\u201d. A Downing Street spokesman said she had told the king that \u201cthe current explanation lacks credibility. She also reiterated that all individuals bearing responsibility for the killing must be properly held to account.\u201d She said suspects would be prevented from entering the UK and any visas would be revoked. \n  \n The crown prince\u2019s remarks were made to a full auditorium of onlookers and guests who listened silently as he responded to a question from a moderator. He distanced himself from the 18 people alleged to have killed and dismembered Khashoggi inside the consulate, and appealed to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, as a partner. On Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan directly accused some of the \u201chighest ranked\u201d Saudis of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s killing, but avoided mentioning Bin Salman by name. \n  \n The prince\u2019s remarks received a short burst of applause and lifted a subdued mood that had heralded his arrival. His entrance had much less fanfare than the inaugural event last year, which had marked the global debut of the 33-year-old heir to the throne. \n  \n \u201cHe\u2019s not going to address the humungous elephant in the room, I bet,\u201d one conference attendee, Heba Saleh, said before the prince\u2019s appearance. Stunned silence met the first mention of Khashoggi\u2019s name, and a palpable relief followed. \n  \n The gruesome killing and its profound implications have cast a pall over the conference, which has been widely boycotted by the international business elite, and partially rescued by regional leaders and last-minute delegations, many of whom have filled seats but pledged little business. American business people are thin on the ground, in stark contrast to 2017, when the halls of the Ritz Carlton conference centre teemed with executives from Fortune 500 companies. \n  \n Some delegates did nothing to hide their disdain for both the crime and the subsequent attempts to cover it up. Four of the alleged killers were members of Bin Salman\u2019s security detail, and the remainder came from the Saudi security establishment. \n  \n \u201cThese idiots have taken us back to the Stone Age,\u201d said one delegate, who refused to be named. \u201cHow do I defend this country to anyone any more? The stupidity here is unparalleled.\u201d \n  \n Others said attempts to quarantine Bin Salman from an act blamed on his closest personal staff, including his domestic enforcer, Saud al-Qahtani, were doomed to backfire. \u201cIt suits many of us to believe this, because the alternative is just too impossible,\u201d said a Saudi businessman who called himself Ahmed Mohammed. \u201cBut anyone who has lived here understands the fiction. And his friends outside cannot be expected to look away like us.\u201d \n  \n Khaled Mansour, another Saudi businessman, said the country had little option but to fall in behind Bin Salman, and that holding senior leaders to account for Khashoggi\u2019s death would set the country back further. \u201cThis is very complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is painful for the family and for the people. It is best to live in denial here.\u201d \n  \n On Tuesday, Donald Trump, an ally of Bin Salman, said for the first time that the prince could have been involved in the operation to kill the dissident Saudi journalist. \u201cWell, the prince is running things over there, more so at this stage. He\u2019s running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,\u201d he said. \n  \n On Wednesday, the Washington Post added to reports in Turkish media that CIA director Gina Haspel had listened to an audio recording said to prove Khashoggi was brutally tortured before his premeditated murder. Haspel flew to Ankara on Monday night to assist Turkey\u2019s investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death. Four sources familiar with the mission brief told Reuters she had asked to view the tapes. \n  \n Play Video 0:45 'Worst cover-up ever': Trump on apparent Khashoggi murder plot \u2013 video \n  \n The Saudi monarch, King Salman, in addition to May, spoke to Erdo\u011fan on Wednesday, a day after the Turkish leader appealed to him to solve a festering crisis between the two regional power bases. An adviser to Erdo\u011fan said the young prince had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d over Khashoggi. Turkish officials have suggested that they will release more information incriminating the Saudi state if King Salman does not move against the son he anointed as his heir 17 months ago. \n  \n Known for convictions that critics describe as brazen arrogance, Bin Salman struck several conciliatory tones during his appearance, the first towards archfoe Qatar, which Saudi Arabia has boycotted for more than a year. \u201cEven though we have our differences with Qatar, in five years\u2019 time they will be in a very different place,\u201d he said. The comments were the first cracks in an unwavering hostility towards the small Gulf state. \n  \n More visibly, the Lebanese prime minister, Sadd Hariri \u2013 who was summoned to Riyadh by Bin Salman 11 months ago, then briefly detained \u2013 was sitting alongside him on the stage. It marked a remarkable reversal of fortunes for a man who had been discarded as a Saudi ally and forced to sign over local assets. \n  \n \u201cSaad Hariri will be here for two more days,\u201d Bin Salman said. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone say he\u2019s been kidnapped. ||||| ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An adviser to Turkey\u2019s leader said on Wednesday Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d over Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the bluntest comments yet from someone linked to Tayyip Erdogan about Riyadh\u2019s de facto ruler in connection with the death. \n  \n Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the remarks. \n  \n Riyadh has blamed a \u201crogue operation\u201d for the death of the prominent Saudi journalist, and said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had no knowledge of the killing. \n  \n Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, disappeared on Oct. 2 when he visited the consulate to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. After weeks of denying any knowledge of his whereabouts, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi was killed in a fistfight in the consulate. \n  \n The kingdom\u2019s shifting explanations have met incredulity internationally and stirred deepening criticism from Turkey and the West. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Saudi authorities staged the \u201cworst cover-up ever\u201d. \n  \n \u201cIt is a disgrace that reaches all the way to Crown Prince (Mohammed bin) Salman. At least five members of the execution team are (Mohammed bin) Salman\u2019s right hands and are people that wouldn\u2019t act without his knowledge,\u201d Ilnur Cevik, an adviser to President Erdogan, wrote in a column in the Yeni Birlik newspaper. \n  \n \u201cEven if U.S. President Trump saves (Mohammed bin) Salman, in the eyes of the world he is a questionable person with Khashoggi\u2019s blood on his hands,\u201d Cevik wrote. \n  \n Cevik is one of many Erdogan advisers and not a prominent one. It was not immediately clear whether the views of the column reflected those of Erdogan, who in speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday highlighted the need for all of those responsible - \u201cfrom those who ordered it to those who carried it out\u201d - to face justice. \n  \n Riyadh has detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of an investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death. One of those fired includes Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to the crown prince. |||||<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nIn this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that agree with each other.

The most urgent needs are to find sensitive markers for early diagnosis for HCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported as a group of small non-coding RNAs that can function as endogenous RNA interference to regulate expression of the targeted genes. This study was conducted to detect the serum and tissue expression of miR 21 and miR 199-a to be applied as early detectors for HCC.   \n METHODS A total of 40 serum and tissue samples (17 samples from chronic hepatitis and 23 samples from HCC patients) were collected. The levels of the two mature miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-199-a) were detected by real time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) in sera and tissues of chronic hepatitis and HCC patients. Besides, miR-21 and miR-199-a levels in relation to clinical and pathological factors were explored.   \n RESULTS We found that the expression of serum miR-21 was distinctly increased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). miR 199-a was distinctly decreased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). In addition, median of miR 21 was increased in malignant when compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues without significant differences (P=0.191) while miR 199-a was significantly decreased in malignant when compared to adjacent nonmalignant tissues (P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that miR-21 and miR-199-a might be potential biomarkers for HCC.   \n CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the expression of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated and miR-199-a was significantly down regulated in serum of patients with HCC. Due to their reasonable sensitivity and specificity for disease progression, miR-21 and miR-199-a could be used as potential circulating biomarkers for HCC..

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.\n\nInput: Sentence: Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765.

Muscle fiber type proportions (I, IIa, and IIb), fiber areas and activities of several enzyme markers of different energy metabolic pathways were determined from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis. Results indicated that Caucasians had a higher percent type I (8%, P less than 0.01) and a lower percent type IIa (6.7%, P less than 0.05) fiber proportions than Africans. No significant differences were observed between the two racial groups in the type IIb fiber proportion or in the three fiber type areas. Enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic [creatine kinase (CK)] and glycolytic [hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] metabolic pathways had significantly higher activities (about 30-40%) in the Black African group than in the Caucasian group (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was noted in the activities of oxidative enzymes [malate dehydrogenase (MDH), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH)]. Consequently, the PFK/OGDH ratio was significantly elevated in Africans (P less than 0.05). The racial differences observed between Africans and Caucasians in fiber type proportion and enzyme activities of the phosphagenic and glycolytic metabolic pathways may well result from inherited variation. These data suggest that sedentary male Black individuals are, in terms of skeletal muscle characteristics, well endowed for sport events of short duration. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nRead the passage and find the corresponding pronoun for the given name.

Passage:In the first dismal months of fighting, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was beaten at Mas Deu and Bellegarde and forced back under the walls of Perpignan. Then the French repelled two Spanish attacks at Perpignan and Peyrestortes. Though the army was defeated again at Truillas and in other actions, the Spanish invaders withdrew to the Tech River in late 1793. Throughout the year the representatives on mission had enormous powers and used them to interfere with the military effort and to arrest officers that they deemed unpatriotic or unsuccessful. In 1794, the army's fortunes improved when Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Dugommier took command. The army drove the Spanish army from France soil at Boulou and recaptured the Fort de Bellegarde and Collioure. After establishing itself on Spanish territory, the army won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Black Mountain in November during which Dugommier was killed. His replacement, Dominique Catherine de P\u00e9rignon soon captured the Sant Ferran fortress and the port of Roses.

Passage 1:Anachlysictis gracilis is an extinct carnivorous mammal belonging to the group Sparassodonta, which were metatherians (a group including marsupials and their close relatives) that inhabited South America during the Cenozoic. Unlike other remains assigned to the family Thylacosmilidae (a group of metatherian predators equipped with \"saber teeth\") that had been found previously, Anachlysictis is the first record of such borhyaenoids in northern South America, and also most primitive and ancient in the family (in fact, is the first confirmed record that did not belong to the genus Thylacosmilus, until the official publication of Patagosmilus in 2010). This species was found in the Villavieja Formation in the area of La Venta in Colombia, a famous fossil deposit in the Middle Miocene (Laventan; 13.8-11.8 million years ago), based on fragments that include a front portion of the lower jaw, with an incipient molar tooth and a piece of carnassial from the front of the maxilla.\n Passage 2:In 2002, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) announced that it would acknowledge the site of Victoria Rink with \"a commemorative plaque or other historical site marker to remind the passers-by of the existence of the Victoria Skating Rink, the birthplace of organized hockey.\" The commemoration has been marked in two ways. On May 22, 2008, a commemorative plaque was dedicated at the nearby Centre Bell, along with a plaque honouring James Creighton. Further, the IIHF created the Victoria Cup, a trophy named for the arena, for which\u2014along with 1 million Swiss francs\u2014one National Hockey League team and the champion of the European Champions Hockey League play-off annually. The first Cup match was held in Berne, Switzerland on October 1, 2008 between the New York Rangers and the Metallurg Magnitogorsk. The next, and last, edition of the Victoria Cup was held in Zurich on September 29, 2009, between the ZSC Lions and the Chicago Blackhawks.\n Passage 3:The film is on Neil Marshall Stevens's spec script Deader, which was submitted to Dimension Films in 2000 during the production of his script Thirteen Ghosts and had been planned to be produced by Stan Winston. As in the final film, it entailed a newspaper reporter being sent to Romania to cover an underground cult who have discovered the secret of immortality and had gained contact with an otherworldly dimension, but did not feature connections to the Hellraiser series. Although Tim Day had wanted to write a direct sequel to  featuring a final conflict between Pinhead and Kirsty, Bob Weinstein directed him to rewrite Deader into a Hellraiser sequel similar in tone to the Japanese horror films Ring, and Pulse. After a brief delay during the production of the 2006 American remake of Pulse, work on Deader resumed. Scott Derrickson was approached to direct but declined, and Rick Bota was rehired from the previous film. The film was originally rewritten to take place in London and later the Lower East Side of Manhattan before the producers opted to film it simultaneously with another Hellraiser sequel, titled  in Romania, between October and December of 2002, to save costs. Production was difficult due to the inability of the Americans in the cast and crew to understand the Romanian set workers and actors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFollow the instruction to complete the task:\nGiven an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation.
